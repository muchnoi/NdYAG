A simple python3 code produces a graphical representation of lasing incipience in Nd:YAG.

Created with a help of pyQT and matplotlib.

Two parameters are varied interactively: pumping power and photon lifetime in a laser cavity.

The plotted values are:

1) N - instant level of inverse population 

2) N<sub>0</sub> - achievable inverse population with current pump speed and no cavity 

3) N<sub>cw</sub> - inverse population in case of continuous wave generation 

4) U - instant level of laser power 

5) U<sub>cw</sub> - laser power in case of continuous wave generation
